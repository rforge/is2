<p><strong>is2</strong> provides a very efficient inference approach of nonlinear partially-observed Markov processes. It is inherited from R package <strong>pomp</strong>, so it can virtually be applied to every model therein. In <strong>is2</strong>, three second order iterated smoothing algorithm are provided, expoiting efficiently estimation of the observed information matrix to increase convergence rate.</p>

<p>At the moment, support is provided for</p>

<ul>
  <li>fixed lag smoothing</li>

  <li>second order iterated smoothing algorithm of Nguyen et al. (2015)(submitted),</li>

  <li>second order iterated smoothing algorithm of Doucet et al. (2013),</li>

  <li>reduced second order iterated smoothing algorithm of Nguyen et al. (2015)(submitted).</li>

</ul>

<p>Simple worked examples are provided in the <code>test</code> directory of the installed package.</p>

<p>Future support for a variety of other algorithms is envisioned. 

<p>Please let the developers know if you find <strong>is2</strong> useful, if you publish results obtained using it, if you come up with improvements, find bugs, or have suggestions or feature requests!</p>
